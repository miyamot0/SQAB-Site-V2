    "Description": "The Behavioral Data Science Research Lab at Endicott College is seeking PhD students interested in conducting basic research on choice; decision-making; verbal behavior; or the complex, multiple control of behavior. Much of our work is quantitative or computational in nature, so having a background in these areas is certainly useful for hitting the ground running; though many successful students have joined the lab without knowing much about either. However, critical to success in the lab are a strong interest in: thinking creatively about the boundary conditions of known behavioral processes; leveraging all scientific tools to best answer research questions; and simply being a good human who supports their colleagues.",

    "PositionTitle": "PhD Student in Behavior Analysis at UF",
    "Description": "My lab is accepting PhD students into the Behavior Analysis Program at the University of Florida to conduct basic and translational research on choice, persistence, and relapse of behavior. Our work spans basic research examining fundamental conditioning processes, translational research aimed at developing and improving models of behavioral interventions for treating challenging behavior, and clinical research in collaboration with applied researchers. We are interested in students from a diverse range of backgrounds and experiences. Experience with programming, statistics, and quantitative analysis is preferred. Students at the bachelors and Masters level are welcome to apply. Students are guaranteed support for five years through at least 9-month teaching or research assistantships. The Behavior Analysis Program at the University of Florida has provided training of PhD students in a supportive learning environment for over 50 years and is led by six full-time faculty members with a diverse range of interests. Please see the associated link for information on applying.",

    "Bio": "My research focuses on the role of fundamental conditioning processes in choice and the relapse of operant behavior, with interests in translating this research to understand and develop behavioral treatments for challenging behavior. I am faculty in the Behavior Analysis Program at the University of Florida, after previously holding faculty positions at Auburn University, the Florida Institute of Technology, and The University of Auckland. I also completed a post doctoral fellowship in Pharmacology at the University of Michigan. I served as Associate Editor for the Journal of the Experimental Analysis of Behavior and Behavioral Processes, am past President of the Society for the Quantitative Analyses of Behavior, and served as board member for the Society for the Experimental Analysis of Behavior. I received both the 2011 BF Skinner Early Career Award from Division 25 of the American Psychological Association and the 2016 Federation of Associations in Behavior and Brain Sciences Early Career Impact Award for the Association for Behavior Analysis International. I am a BCBA-D and received my PhD from Utah State University and a BA from West Virginia University.",

Our programs are housed in the Department of Applied Behavior Analysis and are led by five, full-time faculty members. Located in suburban Caldwell, NJ, Caldwell University is twenty miles from New York City and offers easy access to a range of destinations in the Northeast. The Ph.D. program is most appropriate for students who wish to pursue careers in academia, research careers in applied settings, or leadership positions in clinical settings. Accepted students are provided the opportunity to apply for a fellowship/assistantship through our on-campus Center for Autism & ABA.\n\nI will consider applicants with a bachelor's degree who have interest and experience in applied behavior analysis or those who have completed a master's degree in behavior analysis or a related discipline. Doctoral students in my lab are free to pursue a variety of topics that intersect with my areas of expertise and interest in early behavioral intervention for children with autism spectrum and related disorders, increasing the efficiency of academic instruction, staff and caregiver training, equivalence relations, and mainstream applications of behavior analysis. Numerous opportunities for conducting research, presenting and publishing research, mentoring junior colleagues, teaching undergraduate classes, and editorial work will be provided. Upon graduation, my previous doctoral students have moved into faculty, post-doctoral, or clinical ownership/leadership positions.",

His work focuses on preschool and school-age children that present with various development, behavioral, and learning difficulties. Dr. Gilroy's work incorporates technology in both basic (e.g., operant models of choice, consumption) and applied research (e.g., mobile application development). Students working with Shawn have the opportunity gain experience in both single-case and group design research delivered school and pre-school settings.",
